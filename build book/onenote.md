Hallo, my name is Nadir Van Thielen 
I my studie of wonne work for a respectical companie Siemens Bisnis Service
For 5 yeras i in counter difeceld problems.
And i was yest using the system that was in hand.
And hered a farme work of a other companie novell

This book is intende for peapol the wanne know.
A litte bit historie like a whit hores of the cloud 
I was a long jersie like Json sripts to get the jest words on paper 
I hope you enjoy reding this 


*------* specheal thans to my acediemie the helpt whit love and garatutude  *-----*



this book is covering:
 * - The decripton off , the bios (SD) chip 
 * - Sampel code asembler C++ as well






How to make Ye'our , own os.                                                         *   pgz 1.

The apelented of the code is to handle device notifications.
Is hady to use. and penliedlie for the communety.

thas ar netware code, but it is not used here

NetWare is a network operating system that was developed by Novell in the 1980s.
It was one of the first network operating systems to gain widespread popularity.
NetWare was designed to provide file and print sharing services over a local area network (LAN).
It used a client-server architecture, where the server provided resources and services to client machines.
NetWare was known for its stability, performance, and scalability.
It supported various network protocols, including IPX/SPX and TCP/IP.
NetWare was widely used in businesses and organizations for many years,
