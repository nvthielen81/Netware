Hallo, my name is Nadir Van Thielen 
I my studies of work for a respectively company Siemens Bisnis Service
For 5 years i in counter undetectable problems.
And i was yest using the system that was in hand.
And herded a frame work of a other company novell

This book is intended for papal the wane know.
A Little bit histories like a whit horse of the cloud 
and data frame works programming. 
I was a long jernie like Json script's to get the jest words on paper 
I hope you enjoy Reading this

Handbook i , used for making this book possible ( referees :)


-  CCNE cisco certified network engineer ( cisco Press )
-  Making your own os
-  Maker electronic  ( Elector )






this book is covering:
 * - The decryption off , the bios (SD) chip
 * - Sample code assembler C++ as well

The apelented of the code is to handle device notifications.
Is handy to use. and penliedlie for the communenty.

For the computer to work like a PM post meschesche device.
The uis a component in the computer calld bios wher al the interucsion ar regsterd 
after power on .  AM atoom moduleare divice like a modem or a or a telefoon.

To call send a call the data from the bios that work whit i2c system and 00 to FF.
The BIOS is a PHP post , Humen phone. 
the work in 8bits / 16 bit date bus system.
whit base aderses that can cange over echter per-fix-prosesor in the futher. 


Build the disk installer for the device!
Disk data system key partition FAT format-id string chapa the box scan code deb.
deb is a paper whet electric word form text and data.
that cam from PHP and paper in the hand en pen.
the bood loader cam from a clip a paper clip like e fead

you me hear the tv tinking ow not [tor] time object regstrasion data o own to day. 
[tor] is text object regstrasion frame work programing.
like a bel on the door tor gose the sound ting o the echo galam that cam from.
telegrafie that door bel like telegramm sending .and waitimg for mail like Mirosoft(r) in home.
 whaiting for the post man or wommen. also a good studie book it MCITP.
that read a studed tiping this other handel book .   
and the string ar ascii aders system cloks ii index  / index i/o
from your o clok pen and the bel  from , somwans home  and the Hrts clok wher the disk clok 
the computer t self  , the intergent of tiping is not the iq integent qwaretie of life . 
but is like the i reverst on the stong index the parent data then  eie to will later BASIC bits asci verion 1 the asicroon caste player the the python 90 minits 
and the is the GPT evlusion of programing. so THT GP the 1 site to the other stie GP

thas ar netware code, but it is not used here

NetWare is a network operating system that was developed by Novell in the 1980s.
It was one of the first network operating systems to gain widespread popularity.
NetWare was designed to provide file and print sharing services over a local area network (LAN).
It used a client-server architecture, where the server provided resources and services to client machines.
NetWare was known for its stability, performance, and scalability.
It supported various network protocols, including IPX/SPX and TCP/IP.
NetWare was widely used in businesses and organizations for many years,
