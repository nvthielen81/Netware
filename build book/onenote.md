Hallo, my name is Nadir Van Thielen 
I my studies of work for a respectively company Siemens Bisnis Service
For 5 years i in counter undetectable problems.
And i was yest using the system that was in hand.
And herded a frame work of a other company novell

This book is intended for papal the wane know.
A Little bit histories like a whit horse of the cloud 
and data frame works programming. 
I was a long studies like Json script's to get the jest words on paper ;-)
I hope you enjoy Reading this 


*------* special tanks to my academy the help whit love and gratitude  *-----*




Handbook i , used for making this book possible ( referees :)


-  CCNE cisco certified network engineer ( cisco Press )
-  Making your own os
-  Maker electronic  ( Elector )






this book is covering:
 * - The decryption off , the bios (SD) chip
 * - Sample code assembler C++ as well






How to make Ye'our , own os.                                                            pgz 1.

The appended of the code is to handle device notifications.
Is handy to use. and penlight for the community.
the moment that i, thought to get a own os, came from school
where the telling of o words from letter en s of mummers . 
and by, downing home work.

For the computer to work like a PM post messages device.
The use a component in the computer called bios where the interactions is registered 
after power on, AM atom module-are device like a modem or a or a telephone.
To call send a call the data from the bios that work whit i2c system and 00 to FF.
The BIOS is a PHP post, 
the work in 8bits / 16 bit date bus system.
whit base aderses that can cange over echter per-fix-processor in the futher. 


Build the disk installer for the device!
Disk data system key partition FAT format-id string chapa the box scan code deb.
deb is a paper whet electric word form text and data.
that cam from PHP and paper in the hand en pen.
the bood loader cam from a clip a paper clip like e fead 
that you nead later , for accesing the device system opertatoren system . 
you me hear the tv tinking ow not [tor] time object regstrasion data o own to day. 
[tor] is text object regstrasion frame work programing.
like a bel on the door tor gose the sound ting o the echo galam that cam from.
telegrafie that door bel like telegramm sending .and waitimg for mail like Mirosoft(r) in home.
 whaiting for the post man or wommen. also a good studie book it MCITP.
that read a studed tiping this other handel book .   
and the string ar ascii aders system cloks ii index  / index i/o
from your o clok pen and the bel  from , somwans home  and the Hrts clok wher the disk clok 
the computer t self  , the intergent of tiping is not the iq integent qwaretie of life . 
but is like the i reverst on the stong index the parent data then  eie to will later BASIC bits asci verion 1 the asicroon caste player the the python 90 minits 
and the is the GPT evlusion of programing. so THT GP the 1 site to the other stie GP 
if you have a old casted desk pleayer you mind herd that GP therning wher the power electro moter thar the wile of the like a balp pen.   
de EE/EI the EID the iIDE electron SD system . data a controlpons card. 
you ow pen and i/o that you no momen on paper and also on the mobile device's
like child drawing or darwin strudie of the mind like the cloud hy studie biolgie a told a strie in his life astro tel. wher later never to by leater astronomie en santifica happen evrie day in space.

thas ar netware code, but it is not used here

NetWare is a network operating system that was developed by Novell in the 1980s.
It was one of the first network operating systems to gain widespread popularity.
NetWare was designed to provide file and print sharing services over a local area network (LAN).
It used a client-server architecture, where the server provided resources and services to client machines.
NetWare was known for its stability, performance, and scalability.
It supported various network protocols, including IPX/SPX and TCP/IP.
NetWare was widely used in businesses and organizations for many years,
