Hallo, my name is Nadir Van Thielen 
I my Studie of work for a respectable company worst dialectical. Siemens Basins Service
For 5 years I in counter differed problems.
And I was yest using the system that was in hand.
And hared a framework of another companies’ novel

This book is intended for peapod the want, know.
A little bit history like a whit horse of the cloud 
I was a long jersey like Json scripts to get the jest words on paper 
I hope you enjoy reding this 

*------* special Heald and tanks to my academia the helps whit love and gratitude *-----*

Handbook I, used for making this book possible (referee’s :)

*  CCNE cisco certified network engineer (cisco Press)
*  Making your own OS
*  Maker electronic (Elector)

this book is covering:
 * - The decryption off, the bios (SD) chip 
 * - Sampel code assembler C++ as well
 *- Neuron (NetWare, network)


* Disk Data table:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
in order to program like putting words the creation of a machine you need to know 
the refers engineering of the machine itself, and re-encode the prefix veal.
 A store disk is like an access table, whit an index array.
that when e secure copy and the different between a fast format.
the secure copy or cloning is in portend for later COM (compiler object magmatic) or LTP Lang with tipping person
transferee of data. the computer COM is a serial system that whit a power inverter device
that can get connection whit the internet NUC, nice to get you words, and cards.
or the Network united community, COM is the handling of getting the drive E name 
the E name is necessary for there the mound of the electro disk. 
when a computer work on electrons, before the computer can calculate the 
sector or get data we need a clock and a sector is the chord word for 
System Electronic clock tipping object registration.
De index bits are set to 0 when a secure erase set all the bits to 0
where in the NUC no income data is accepted.
this is important to know bocos you cone put data and read data trac disk. 
the time regisstrion atom calculator.
and the disk i/o or 1 and 0 in active access across link data files.
thas wy the Sector disk has a file index bus bits u ° 0 ones and zerowes of the 
time regisstrion system key. slots of the clutters. 00b0 like the defrag disk in the old days of MS/Dos
but this knowing is necessary to read and whit data, or ever store data on a system.
Like the telegraphy of the CLU contact Lang witches of the untied international telecom TTY 
The TT time ticking and electronic type reciter. the 0b00 and the HEX clock Execute the time up counter and scan the system communication bus atoms and n of magnetic storricht chips
MSN is also older than we tink the fesr tape of DATA machine en N virbrions 
or on the lp record 
















* Disk Data table :
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A store disk is like a access table, whit a index. 
that when e secure copy and the different between a fast format
de index bits are set to 0 when a secure erase set al the bits to 0
recovery system like medicine systems in hospitals . 

DD or DOS/DOS Data objective system ,
